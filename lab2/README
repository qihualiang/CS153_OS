Lab 2: Scheduler


Change the scheduler from a simple round-robin to a priority scheduler. Add a priority value to each process (taking a range between 0 to 31). The range does not matter, it is just a proof of concept. When scheduling from the ready list you will always schedule the highest priority thread/process first.

Add a system call to change the priority of a process. A process can change its priority at any time. If the priority becomes lower than any process on the ready list, you must switch to that process.

To avoid starvation, implement aging of priority. If a process waits increase its priority. When it runs, decrease it.
